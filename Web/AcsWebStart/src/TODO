when arena is rebooted, tomcat doesn't automatically start.
also, our webapplications do not automatically get started by tomcat.
this is not a viable solution in the long run.

i realize that the length of jnlp files reported by the server logic is (reproducible for some of
the jnlp files) always 6 bytes larger than the actual files. this makes a strict http-client assume the
input stream is broken. with the javaws plugin this doesn't matter since it is lenient enough to deal
with this case, but wget falls into this trap. there's something wrong in the state of denmark.

examples for checking:
a) direct link
wget "http://www.eso.org/projects/alma/AcsWebStart/CommandCenter.jnlp" -O CommandCenter.wget --debug
b) through the GetFileServlet:
wget "http://www.eso.org/projects/alma/AcsWebStart/jnlp.html?file=AvailabilityTest.jnlp&host=localhost&acsinstance=0" -O AvailabilityTest.wget --debug

about the variable-expansion in jnlp-files:
the fact that names of variables must not be a prefix of any other variable is a 
wonderful source of potential bugs. change the implementation.
a) an idea is to use a different syntax: $${hostname} instead of $$hostname.
   problem is sun's jnlp-servlet uses the $$name syntax, so we'd have two different
   notations for variables
b) by clever sorting: expand long variables first, so $$name_serving and $$name wouldn't clash
