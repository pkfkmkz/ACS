1) This directory contains the documentation for the Next ACS release
   under development.
   Therefore, the Makefile use the "HEAD" CVS TAG to identify the proper versions of the
   files in the CVS archive.

2) This directory contains many PDF files generated from MS Word
   document.
   See the .cvsignore file for a list of such files.

3) Some documents come from external sources and whenever a new
   version is available it needs to be updated from the original
   source by archiving here the newer version available.
