<h2><a name="ACSSoftwareReleases" id="ACSSoftwareReleases"></a>ACS Software Releases</h2>
<p>ACS 0.0, released in September 2000 was essentially a concept 
  demonstration prototype. With the support of some components taken from the 
  VLT Control Software it has been used to develop a prototype control system 
  for the 12m Kitt Peak antenna. This was successfully tested in December 2000. 
  ACS 1.0, released in September 2001, is the first "production release".</p>
<p>Initially our development cycle consisted of incremental releases with one major release every year, plus a couple of intermediate 
  releases during that year. The numbering of each release consisted of 2 numbers: the major release followed by the minor release.</p>
<p>The yearly major releases often contained some backward incompatible changes. 
   The minor releases were backward compatible for compilation unless some feature request or bug fix required an incompatible change.
   Even releases that don't required code changes usually bring about some porting effort, e.g. because some log output that gets evaluated in the modular tests may change and requires an update of the reference files.</p>
<p>When the construction phase of the telescope terminated and the operation started the development cycle has been changed to several, 4 in average, incremental releases every year</p>
<p>Starting with ACS 6.0.4, for every release of ACS we maintain a branch to fix problems that would block work at the OSF. </p>
<p>ACS 12.3 has been the last release produced with a name containing the major and minor release numbers: a new naming schema has been introduced to be consistent with all the other ALMA subsystems.
   This naming schema consists of the year plus an incremental number like for example ACS 2014.2.
<p>ACS follows a release branch schema i.e. a branch is created for each new release whose name resembles the name of the release i.e. 2014-02-ACS-B.</p>
<p>From version 10, ACS is distributed through the ESO ftp server, <a href="ftp://ftp.eso.org">ftp.eso.org</a>: contact us to obtain the username and password.
<br>The ftp server is divided in two main areas: <b>public</b> for the LGPL distribution and <b>restricted</b> for the NO-LGPL distribution used internally by ALMA and that contains tools and libraries that cannot be freely redistributed.</p>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <a href="http://www.eso.org/projects/alma/AcsWebStart/latest/index.html">AcsWebStart</a>: NOT YET PORTED.... <br>
    ACS Pure-Java applications can be executed on any machine supporting Java Web Start technology.<br>
Java Web Start allows automatic installation and upgrades from the Web in a very user friendly way.<br>
In particular it is possible to execute on any PC ACS clients like Administrator Client or Object Explorer agains any ACS running on another host.<br>
Any pure-Java ACS application can be deployed using web start. The <a href="http://www.eso.org/%7Emschilli/webstart-ot/">OT prototype</a> is one example.</li>
