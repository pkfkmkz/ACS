BulkData Sender in Java
=======================

This is a quick tutorial about how to build, install and use BulkData Sender in Java.
The procedure in this tutorial was tested in the following environment.

 - CentOS 7.7.1908 (x86)
 - ACS-2019DEC [/alma/ACS-2019DEC]
 - RTI ndds.5.1.0 [/alma/RTI/ndds.5.1.0]
 - OpenJDK 11.0.6

------------------------
Prepare your environment
------------------------

 $ export INTROOT=/alma/ACS-2019DEC/introot
 $ source /alma/ACS-2019DEC/ACSSW/config/.acs/.bash_profile.acs
 $ cd /alma/ACS-2019DEC
 $ getTemplateForDirectory INTROOT introot

------------------------
How to build and install
------------------------

 $ cd /path/to/almasw/ACS/LGPL/CommonSoftware/bulkDataNT/src
 $ make
 $ make install

As a consequence, both C/C++ and Java libraries are built and installed. JAR files can be found in /alma/ACS-2019DEC/introot/lib. Some programs to test the functionality of the libraries are installed in /alma/ACS-2019DEC/introot/bin.

How to quickly test
-------------------

If you do not want to write your Java code, but you want to try out this Java library, you can use example programs. First, you need to launch ACS.

 $ acsStart

Then, you first need to launch a receiver which is implemented in C++ (there is no Java version).

 $ bulkDataNTGenReceiver -s TestStream -f TestFlow

"-s" option specifies the stream name and "-f" option specifies the flow name. The receiver is now waiting for data on TestFlow in TestStream. So, let's open a new terminal and start a sender implemented in Java.

 $ export INTROOT=/alma/ACS-2019DEC/introot
 $ source /alma/ACS-2019DEC/ACSSW/config/.acs/.bash_profile.acs
 $ bulkDataNTGenSenderJava -s TestStream -f TestFlow

The sender automatically connects to TestFlow in TestStream. Once a message like "press ENTER to send data (start/data/stop) to connected receivers ..." is shown, press ENTER. Then, the sender starts to send data to the receiver. Now you should be able to see some results on the receiver side.


The usage of bulkDataNTGenSenderJava is the same as C++ version (bulkDataNTGenSender). The Java version implements the same command line options as the C++ version. To see more options, run it with "--help" option.

Documentation

 $ cd /path/to/almasw/ACS/LGPL/CommonSoftware/bulkDataNT/src
 $ make javadoc

Javadoc of Bulkdata Sender is generated under /path/to/almasw/ACS/LGPL/CommonSoftware/bulkDataNT/doc/api/html/. Example usage of this Java library can be found in the package summary of alma.acs.bulkdata.
