/**
 * This class represents one BulkData Stream at the sender side.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A Sender Stream is a conceptual group that contains one or more Flows.
 * Each stream can be identified by the name within one JVM process, and
 * the streams with the same name are now allowed in one JVM process.
 * 
 * <p>
 * To create a new Sender Stream, use the constructor
 * {@link #BulkDataNTSenderStream(String, BulkDataNTSenderStreamConfiguration)}
 * of this class.
 * 
 * <p>
 * After you create a Sender Stream, you can freely create new Flows
 * under the Stream by calling
 * {@link #createFlow(String, Optional)} or
 * {@link #createFlow(String, Optional, BulkDataNTSenderFlowConfiguration)}.
 * Once you finish using the Flow, destroy it by calling
 * {@link #deleteFlow(BulkDataNTSenderFlow)}. It will release resources
 * allocated to the Flow and unregister the Flow from this Stream.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When you finish using this Stream, call {@link #destroy()}. It will
 * first try to destroy all Flows in this Stream if any, and then destroy
 * the Stream itself and release resources allocated to this Stream.
 * {@link #destroy()} must be called before you finish your application.
 * Otherwise, your application may not properly quit.
